# Go Movie Importer

This Go project is a challenge offered by DevGym, which you can find at [DevGym Challenge](https://app.devgym.com.br/challenges/ec36e7e2-6a2d-4406-98e1-3029f843b5c3).

The challenge involves creating a script that reads a large CSV file and loads its data into a database.

## How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Set up the database by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

2. Run the script using the following command:
```bash
go run ./cmd/.
```

This command executes the Go script that reads the CSV file and imports its data into the database.

Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs or to meet the requirements of the DevGym challenge.
